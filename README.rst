Nonogram Solver
===============

|  |ci-status|

This project provides a general nonogram solver. It can determine if a puzzle is not solveable by a human, and if it is solveable, can provide the solution.

This solver can be used to create nonogram puzzles given a successful final solution. If the given solution is not solvable, the solver will suggest "hint" squares to be filled in when the nonogram is given to a human solver.
